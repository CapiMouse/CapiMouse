<h3 align="align="justify" style="font-size: 18px;">I am a internal medicine specialist with a great interest in programming. Maybe there arenâ€™t many doctor-programmers in this worldâ€”is that an advantage? For me, curiosity is the driving force behind learning, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my knowledge. The internet is an infinite universe for self-learning, and I love exploring its possibilities.

Additionally, I enjoy traveling and working at the same time, combining both passions. Perseverance is key in everything I do; if a problem arises, I always seek the simplest and most efficient solution to implement. Simplicity is a virtue, and I firmly believe that complexity doesnâ€™t have to be complicated.</h3>

Give back to the coding community that has helped me.<br>ðŸŽ² Fun fact: I'm a doctor who codes â€” maybe I should write a script to diagnose bugs!</p>
